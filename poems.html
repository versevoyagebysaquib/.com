        <h3>MY WISH TO THE FALLEN EYELASH 1</h3>
        <p>"I rub my eyes absentmindely..."</p>
        <a href="I rub my eyes absentmindedly, and an eyelash falls softly onto my palm.

It stares at me lovingly opening it's arms to welcome my prayers.

I don't know if it can hear me, but instinctively, I press it between my hands and make a wish which without fail, is always you.

It is as though my soul has memorized this prayer, repeating it endlessly to be with you, to hold you, to share every heartbeat and every tomorrow with you.

I wish for the blessing to breathe in your arms, for the eternity of your love, for a lifetime where we are never apart.

I wonder if the eyelash can hear to me or if the universe is already tired of my constant demand. But I never stop

Even though I already have you, my heart aches to ensure that we never lose what we've found.

So, I never miss a chance to wish for you-to keep you forever in my arms.">Read More</a>
